What do anarchists want?
==================

Everyone is different, and everyone should have the
freedom to grow as a person. But this can only happen
with the help of other people. People help shape
the society they live in, and in turn the society is shaped
by what its people say and do.

So, it's very important to build a society where people
have as much freedom to grow as possible. Anarchists
believe there are three parts to this:

* freedom (also called "liberty"),
* fairness (also called "equality"), and
* co-operation (also called "solidarity").

**Freedom** is important because it allows people the space
to grow. Nobody can grow as a person when someone else
is restricting everything they do and say. The more
freedom they have, the more they can grow. So people
must build society by working as they want to,
rather than working because they are forced to.

**Fairness** is important because you can't have freedom
without it. If some people have more things or money
than others, they will have power over everyone with
less. So everyone needs fair shares.

**Co-operation** is important because otherwise
society falls apart. Everyone needs to look out for
everyone else. That makes things better for everyone.
So, by looking out for everyone else, you
look out for yourself too.

These three ideas build up both society as a whole,
and everyone in it. But they are not something that
can be forced on people from the outside.
Anarchists believe that society must organise itself,
rather than being told how to organise by a god or government.
In order for that to happen,
these ideas must live in the minds of all people.
Then people can organise themselves.
